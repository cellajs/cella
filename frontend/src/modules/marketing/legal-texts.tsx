            First of all, great to have you here! However, there are some rules you need to agree to before you use this application and services
            (“Services”). When we use the word “Services,” we mean the {appName} web-based application and all applications and functionalities within
            it, available through

              {config.frontendUrl}
            </a>
            but also under sub domains and other domains of our clients, sometimes under an alternative name given by the client. If you have any
            questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact {companyFull}.

          <p>
            These Terms of use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and the owner/provider of {appName}, {companyFull}
            (henceforth called “{companyShort},”, or “we” or “us”). You must agree and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the
            Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you
            use the Services. These Terms of use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and the owner/provider of {appName}, {companyFull}

            These Terms include the provisions in this document and in the

          <p>
            Our Services are constantly changing, to keep up with the dynamic needs of learners everywhere - so, these Terms might need to change,
            too. If they do change, {companyShort} will do our best to tell you in advance by placing a notification on the {appName} website, or{' '}
            {companyShort} might send you an email. In certain situations (for example, where a change to the Terms is necessary to comply with legal
            requirements), {companyShort} may not be able to give you advance notice. Changes to the

          </p>

          <p>
            If you don’t like the new Terms, you are free to reject them - unfortunately, that means you won’t be able to use the Services anymore. If
            you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, then please remember that means you agree to all of the Terms.

            Except for changes by {companyShort} as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in

            First, you have to sign up for an account. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about
            yourself. You can’t select a name that you don’t have the rights to use or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that
            person. In certain situations, your username may be selected for you by your organization; the same rules apply to them when they select a

            You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s
            permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these
            Terms on behalf of an organization or entity (for example, if you’re an administrator agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your
            organization), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind
            them to these Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            You promise to only use the Services in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited
            by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. {companyShort} can’t and won’t be responsible for you using the
            Services in a way that breaks the law.

          <h3 className="font-medium">Intellectual Property</h3>

          <h4 className="font-medium">The Content</h4>

          <p>
            The materials displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photos, images,
            illustrations, User Submissions (defined below), and so forth) (the “Content”) are protected by copyright and other intellectual property
            laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access
            through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload,
            display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of
            that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including {companyShort}’s) rights. For example, if someone shares a really
            creative idea with you on {appName}, that doesn’t mean you can print it out and start distributing it to other people - unless the owner
            specifically told you in writing that you could.
          </p>

          <p>
            You understand that {companyShort} owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of,
            reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean
            that all the restrictions above don’t apply.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-medium">User Submissions</h4>

          <p>
            Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions are
            viewable by other users and some are submissions done as a group of users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and
            to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the
            following licenses are subject to our
            <Link className="mx-1" to="/legal">
              Privacy policy
            </Link>
            to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.
          </p>

          <p>
            User Submissions can only be shared within a Limited Access Group, most likely a group of organization members, or otherwise in a manner
            that only certain specified users can view (each, a “Limited Access User Submission”), then you grant {companyShort} the license above, as
            well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Access User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that Limited
            Access User Submission to other members of that Limited Access Group (or to such specified users, as applicable) and providing you the
            Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant the other members of that Limited Access Group (or such specified users, as applicable) a
            license to access that Limited Access User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the
            Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, you understand and agree that {companyShort}, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users
            (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical
            requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-medium">Responsibility</h4>

          <p>
            Any information or context publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from
            whom such context originated, and you access all such information and context at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or
            omissions in that information or context or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no
            duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been
            exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
            The Services may contain, or direct you to websites containing, information you may find offensive or inappropriate; we can’t control
            that, but please let us know if it happens and we’ll try to remedy the situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users
            gain access to the Services. But that doesn’t mean we don’t take security seriously.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights
            necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You
            are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services. Given the nature of {appName}, it is not advised to post highly
            personal or sensitive information. We also strongly advice not to share privacy-sensitive information such as healthcare information or
            information of a very personal nature.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned, operated, or controlled by{' '}
            {companyShort}. When you access third party websites or use third party services (including, without limitation, your use of Publisher
            Software, defined below), you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that {companyShort} is not responsible for such risks. We
            encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website
            or service that you visit or utilize.

          <p>
            {appName} is a dynamic application, so the Services will change over time. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the
            Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll
            try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.
            Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if
            someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), or without any reason, and without notice.

            {companyShort} is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason, including your
            breach of these Terms. {companyShort} has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in
            these Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to
            terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to
            retrieve any important documents you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but {companyShort}{' '}
            may not do so if it determines it would be impractical, illegal, or would not be in the interest of someone’s safety or security to do so.

            regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.
