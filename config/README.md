# Config
In this folder you find the config files to set up all kinds of app-specific configurations that can be made public. Each mode (`development`, `production` etc) gets its own config file.

### Roadmap
* Add `staging` mode
* Make `tunnel` mode operational
* Local overwrite in .gitignore for testing or development purposes
* A CLI interface that serves a migration guide when there are (breaking) changes in this config.
