# Permissions: contextual RBAC

Cella answers one question everywhere: **may this actor perform this action on this subject?** The answer comes from a single decision engine in `shared/src/permissions/`, computed from the actor's memberships, a static role × context policy matrix, and the subject's own row data. The engine is tier-neutral and ORM-free, so the backend, the frontend, and the standalone Yjs relay all reach the same verdict from the same code — the relay authorizes without a backend round-trip.

Roles are **scoped to channel entities**, never global. Product entities own no roles at all: they inherit their permissions from ancestor contexts. Ownership is an *implicit* relation derived from the row's `createdBy` column rather than a stored tuple.

Postgres RLS is a **separate, coarser layer**. It enforces tenant isolation and knows nothing about roles, policies, or actions. See [Architecture](/docs/page/architecture) for how the two combine into defense in depth.

```

The engine **never loads rows**. Callers resolve whatever row data a decision needs and hand it in. That keeps `shared/` free of any ORM, makes the same function callable from a Postgres-only worker, and makes the check-form/SQL-form parity property testable.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Channel entity** | Owns roles and memberships (`organization` in the template). Orders as `[self, ...ancestors]`. |
| **Product entity** | Owns no roles; inherits from ancestor contexts (`attachment`). Orders as `[...ancestors]`. Must have a context parent. |
| **User entity** | Carries no policies at all; `configurePermissions` filters it out. |
| **Membership** | The engine reads only `{ channelType, channelId, role }`. Explicit `user → context` relation. |
| **Subject** | What is being acted on: entity type, optional id, `channelIds` scope, and optionally `row` / `parentRow`. |
| **Policy cell** | `0` (deny), `1` (allow), or a `RowCondition` (allow on qualifying rows). |
| **Action** | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` (`appConfig.entityActions`). |
| **Grant source** | Why an action was allowed: `membership`, `relation`, `public`, or `systemAdmin`. |

## Configuration

Two files, both fork-facing. They must change together — the hierarchy defines what contexts exist, the policies must then cover every role in every one of them.

**`shared/config/hierarchy-config.ts`** — a fluent builder, not an object literal:

```ts
export const roles = createRoleRegistry(['admin', 'member'] as const);

export const hierarchy = createEntityHierarchy(roles)
  .user()
  .channel('organization', { parent: null, roles: roles.all })
  .product('attachment', { parent: 'organization' })
  .build();
```

**`shared/config/permissions-config.ts`** — declares the matrix and returns both maps:

```ts
export const { accessPolicies, publicReadGrants } = configurePermissions(
  appConfig.entityTypes,
  ({ subject, contexts }) => {
    switch (subject.name) {
      case 'organization':
        contexts.organization.admin({ read: 1, update: 1, delete: 1 });
        contexts.organization.member({ read: 1, update: 0, delete: 0 });
        break;
      case 'attachment':
        contexts.organization.admin({ create: 1, read: 1, update: 1, delete: 1 });
        contexts.organization.member({ create: 1, read: 1, update: 'own', delete: 'own' });
        break;
    }
  },
);
```

Any action you omit defaults to `0`. The `'own'` literal is sugar: it is normalized into the built-in `own` row condition at config time, so the engine only ever sees `0 | 1 | RowCondition`.

Two validators run at boot, both fail-loud by design:

- **`validatePolicyCompleteness`** — every subject that declares any row must declare a row for *every role of every context in its ancestor chain*. An all-zero row (`contexts.x.role({})`) is the explicit way to say "no access". This exists because a missing policy row makes the engine **throw at request time**, and a 500 at request time is a far worse failure than a 500 at boot.
- **`validatePublicReadGrants`** — a `publicParent` grant requires the parent subject to actually be publicly readable.

For channel entities, note the two row kinds: **elevation** rows sit on an *ancestor* context and say what a parent's member may do to the child (this is where `create` lives); **self** rows sit on the same context and say what the entity's own members may do to it (`create` is meaningless there). Product entities have only *home* rows, where `create` grants making the product inside that context.

## The decision

`getAllDecisions(policies, memberships, subject, options)` is the core; `checkPermission` is the bound entry point every tier actually calls — it injects the configured `publicReadGrants` and `elevatedRoles`. Subjects and decisions are batchable, and batching is meaningfully faster than looping.

```ts
export type SubjectForPermission = {
  entityType: ChannelEntityType | ProductEntityType;
  id?: string;
  createdBy?: string | null;
  channelIds: ChannelScope;              // Partial<Record<ChannelEntityType, string | null>>
  row?: Record<string, unknown>;         // for row conditions + publicSelf
  parentRow?: Record<string, unknown>;   // for publicParent
};

export interface PermissionDecision<T extends PermissionMembership = PermissionMembership> {
  subject: { entityType; id?; channelIds };
  orderedChannels: ChannelEntityType[];  // most-specific → root
  primaryChannel: ChannelEntityType;     // orderedChannels[0]
  actions: Record<EntityActionType, { enabled: boolean; grantedBy: GrantSource[] }>;
  can: Record<EntityActionType, boolean>;
  membership: T | null;
}
```

Ancestor scope is **explicitly tri-state**, and the distinction is load-bearing: `undefined` means a required scope was omitted and throws `MissingScopeError`; `null` means deliberately not scoped to that ancestor; a string means scoped to a concrete context id. Silently treating a missing scope as "unscoped" would be a permission bypass, so it is a hard error — surfaced as HTTP 400 `missing_scope` on the backend and WS close `4400` in the relay.

Boundary code that starts from DB rows, route params, or CDC events uses `buildSubject()` to turn column-shaped input (`{ organizationId: 'org_x' }`) into this domain shape. Internals read `subject.channelIds.organization`, never a DB column name.

`grantedBy` is not decoration. It records *why* an action was allowed, which is what makes "why can this user delete?" answerable, and it is what the audit path reads.

## Widening: row conditions and public read

Two mechanisms widen access beyond the policy matrix, and both read the row's own columns. There are exactly two rules — `own` and `public` — and that set is **closed**: it is not a fork extension point. The reasoning is in Constraints; the mechanism is here.

A **row condition** (`shared/src/permissions/row-conditions.ts`) qualifies a grant per row. A cell of `1` grants the action on every row the context scope reaches; a condition cell grants it only on rows the condition matches. A condition is pure data — a name and a `RowPredicate` from a closed vocabulary:

```ts
export type RowPredicate =
  | { kind: 'columnEqualsActor'; column: string }   // row[column] === acting user id (anonymous never matches)
  | { kind: 'columnIsNotNull'; column: string };    // row[column] is set (actor-independent)

export interface RowCondition {
  name: string;
  predicate: RowPredicate;
}

export const own = { name: 'own', predicate: { kind: 'columnEqualsActor', column: 'createdBy' } };
```

The predicate is the single source of truth. Two shared interpreters read it — `rowPredicateMatches` (JS, in `shared/`) and `compileRowConditionSql` (Drizzle, in `backend/`) — so a condition's check-form and SQL-form **cannot drift from each other**: there are no per-condition implementations to keep in sync, only the two interpreters, which the parity property test proves equal. The `shared/`→`backend/` split is why the predicate is a declarative descriptor rather than an inline query builder: `shared/` is ORM-free, so it emits the predicate and the backend compiles it.

**Public read** (`shared/src/permissions/public-read.ts`) makes rows readable by *any* actor, anonymous included, independent of memberships. One rule: the row's own `publicAt` is set. Declared per subject with `publicRead('publicSelf')`, it widens `read` and nothing else. It is *not* a policy cell — it grants with no membership — but it is the same `RowCondition` shape, so it rides the same interpreters and the same parity test:

```ts
export const publicRow = { name: 'public', predicate: { kind: 'columnIsNotNull', column: 'publicAt' } };
```

**Publication does not cascade.** A public parent does not publish its children, and that is a deliberate constraint, not a missing feature. A cross-row rule is unenforceable in the two paths that must agree with the engine: the collection-read SQL compiler would need a join, and CDC stream dispatch only ever ships the row itself. So cascading publication is a **data** concern — propagate `publicAt` down to descendant rows (trigger or app logic), and every path keeps reading one self-describing column.

## The actor

Every check takes an explicit `Actor`. It is a discriminated union, not an optional `userId`, and that shape is load-bearing:

```ts
export type Actor = { userId: string; isSystemAdmin?: boolean } | { anonymous: true };
```

An optional actor is how permission bugs get in. A caller that simply forgets it still compiles, and every rule that reads the actor — `'own'`, and any fork condition — then silently fails **closed**: a denial nobody notices, in a path nobody tested. Anonymity has to be *stated*, not achieved by omission, and `{ anonymous: true }` cannot be produced by accident.

On the backend, handlers never assemble one by hand: `actorFrom(ctx)` reads the guard-populated `userId` and `isSystemAdmin` straight off the request context.

## Enforcement paths

The engine produces a verdict. Each tier is responsible for *asking* — and every one of them now asks with the same inputs.

| Path | Entry point | What it checks |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Guard chain** | `authGuard` → `tenantGuard` → `orgGuard` | Coarse gate only: authenticated, in-tenant, and a member of the org *or* a system admin. It does **not** consult `accessPolicies`. |
| **Single row** | `getValidProductEntity`, `getValidChannelEntity`, `canCreateEntity`, `splitByPermission` | Loads the row, passes it as `subject.row` via `buildSubjectFromEntity`, runs the engine. `splitByPermission` powers bulk ops and 403s only when *nothing* is allowed. |
| **Collection read** | `resolveCollectionReadFilter` → `buildCollectionReadWhere` | Turns the actor's access into a readable scope, then compiles it — unconditional grants, row conditions, and the public grant — into one Drizzle `SQL` predicate. Set-based, so it never materializes rows to reject them. |
| **SSE dispatch** | `canReceiveEntityEvent` | Runs the engine per event row. Doubles as cacheToken issuance, so over-notifying is a data leak, not just noise. |
| **Yjs relay** | `canEditEntity` on WS upgrade | Reads the entity row and memberships over raw `pg` (table/column names derived via `toTableName`/`toColumnName`), then runs the same engine. |
| **Postgres RLS** | `tenantRead` / `tenantContext` | Tenant isolation only. Not a permission layer. |

Two rules keep these honest, and both were once broken:

- **The system-admin bypass applies everywhere**, including collection reads. A sysadmin passes `orgGuard` with *no membership*, so a membership-only scope resolver hands them an empty list while single-row reads of the very same rows succeed.
- **Public rows appear in lists.** A grant that only the single-row path honours is worse than no grant at all: the row is fetchable by id and pushed over SSE, but silently absent from every collection.

The collection path returns a deliberate **tri-state**, so that "no restriction" can never be confused with "no rows":

```ts
export type CollectionReadWhere =
  | { kind: 'all' }             // org-wide read: no scope restriction
  | { kind: 'none' }            // no readable scope: return [] without querying
  | { kind: 'where'; where: SQL };
```

A bare `undefined` WHERE would leak the table, which is exactly the bug this shape makes unrepresentable. In the same spirit, the compiled SQL for a row condition emits `false` for an anonymous actor, mirroring the check-form's deny.

## Testing the invariants

The load-bearing test is the parity property test in `backend/src/permissions/row-predicates.test.ts`, which runs against a real Postgres. It generates random policies, memberships, and actors, then asserts row-for-row that independent implementations agree: the engine's `getAllDecisions`, the compiled SQL executed against a scratch table, the frontend's `computeCan` + `resolvePermission`, and — under the real app config — SSE dispatch. It covers deep ancestor chains and `elevatedRoles` via a synthetic topology. A deterministic PRNG means failures reproduce.

That test is what lets the SQL compiler exist at all: two hand-written implementations of the same rule *will* drift, so the drift is pinned rather than trusted. `topology.ts` / `resolve-topology.ts` exist as the seam that makes this possible — they let tests drive the engine on a synthetic hierarchy without module mocks, so a two-level template config can still exercise deep-chain behavior.

**The scenario space is the test.** It varies `isSystemAdmin` and public read grants, and it must keep doing so: for a long time it pinned `isSystemAdmin: false` and generated no public rows, and *both* of the divergences listed above lived comfortably underneath it, green. A parity test only pins the axes it actually varies. If you add a dimension to the permission model, add it here in the same commit, and confirm the test goes red when you remove the fix.

The rest of the suite covers grant attribution, `'own'` denial when the actor or `createdBy` is absent, public read for anonymous actors, policy completeness, the `null`-vs-`undefined` scope distinction, and a perf floor (100 entities under 10 ms; batch at least 2× a loop).

## Behavior

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Org admin acts on a product in their org | Allowed unconditionally, `grantedBy: membership` |
| Member with `update: 'own'` edits a row they created | Allowed, `grantedBy: relation` (`own`) |
| Member with `update: 'own'` edits someone else's row | Denied. The UI optimistically enables the control; the backend rejects on save |
| Actor reads a row whose `publicAt` is set (entity declares `publicRead()`) | Allowed, `grantedBy: public` — single-row, in lists, and over SSE alike. Anonymous actors included |
| Row's parent is public but the row itself is not | Denied. Publication does not cascade through the engine; propagate `publicAt` to the row |
| System admin acts on any single row | Allowed, `grantedBy: systemAdmin`, short-circuited before membership lookup |
| System admin without an org membership lists a collection | Every row in the org. The bypass applies to the collection path too |
| Membership role has no policy row for the subject | **Throws** at request time. Prevented at boot by `validatePolicyCompleteness` |
| Required ancestor scope omitted from `channelIds` | Throws `MissingScopeError` → 400 `missing_scope` / WS `4400`. Never silently unscoped |
| Actor loses access mid-Yjs-session | The relay's materialization re-checks `update` on the backend before persisting |
| System admin joins a Yjs collab session | No bypass. Collaborative editing is authorized as the acting user, matching materialization |

## Constraints

**Deliberate non-goals:**

- **No per-row narrowing.** Row conditions and public read only ever widen. Visibility variance belongs at the *type* level — give the entity its own policy matrix — so read visibility stays a function of the context chain, memberships × the static matrix, and the row's own data.
- **No explicit relation tuples.** Ownership is implicit, derived from `createdBy`. This keeps the model small while leaving a path to real tuples if a fork needs them.
- **Every rule reads one row: its own.** The engine never loads rows, and no rule may depend on another row. This is the constraint the whole design rests on — it is what lets the check-form, the compiled SQL, and CDC dispatch reach the same verdict from the same data. A rule that needed a *second* row would be evaluable by the engine, need a join in SQL, and be flatly impossible in dispatch (which only ever ships the row itself). Three paths, three answers. So cross-row semantics are pushed into the data instead: denormalize the column, and every path can see it.
- **Row conditions are a closed set, not an extension point.** There are two — `own` and `public` — and the `RowPredicate` vocabulary has two kinds — `columnEqualsActor` and `columnIsNotNull`. A rule that can't be expressed as a predicate over the row's own columns can't be compiled into a collection read, so it has no place in the model; and the vocabulary is deliberately *not* open, so nothing can express one. Adding a kind is a compile-enforced edit to both interpreters plus a parity scenario — a considered change to the engine, not a fork knob. This is what keeps the reader's model finite: deny / allow / owner-only, plus a public flag.
- **Fail-loud config.** A missing policy row throws rather than denying, and a row condition on a `create` cell (which can never match — no row exists yet) throws at boot too. An incomplete or nonsensical matrix fails at startup, never as a silent request-time denial.
- **System admins get no Yjs bypass.** Collaborative editing is authorized as the acting user. The relay and the backend's materialize endpoint take the same stance, so the WS check and the write it eventually triggers agree.

**Dormant features.** Both are fully implemented, tested, and enforced across every path — but inert until a fork opts in:

- **`elevatedRoles` is `undefined`.** When set, a *non-listed* role's product grant speaks only for rows homed at its own context level, while listed roles keep full subtree scope. Only meaningful in forks with nested context chains.
- **No entity declares `publicRead()`.** Every context and product row carries a nullable `publicAt` column, but nothing sets it and no subject declares the grant, so the mechanism costs nothing until a fork wants it.

**Public read meets RLS at the anonymous boundary — decide before you ship public sharing.** Public read grants rows to *anonymous* actors, but tenant-scoped product tables have fail-closed RLS SELECT policies keyed on `app.tenant_id`, and an anonymous request has no tenant context — so an anonymous public read returns **zero rows at the RLS layer** regardless of the engine's verdict. This is unreachable today (no route serves anonymous product reads, no entity declares `publicRead()`), but the first public-sharing feature hits it immediately, and it will look like a permission bug when it is an RLS one. Resolve it deliberately when the feature is real: either give anonymous public reads a tenant-resolving path (derive `tenant_id` from the shared resource, e.g. a share token or slug, before the RLS query), or scope public read to authenticated non-members only. The permission layer and the RLS layer must agree on whether "anonymous" is a thing.

**CDC carries the columns the two rules read.** SSE dispatch runs the engine per event, so the change row must carry the columns the conditions read — `createdBy` (for `own`) and `publicAt` (for `public`). CDC slims each row to exactly the permission-relevant set (`permissionRowKeys` in `cdc/src/utils/permission-row-data.ts`); both columns already ship. Because the condition set is closed, this list is fixed — there is no fork column to add.
