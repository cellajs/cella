# Locales

Here you can manage your locales. The basics are:

- about: for marketing page translations
- app: for app-specific translations.
- app-errors: for app error translations, so you could assign app-specific type.
- backend: backend-only translations
- common: translations that are required for the basics that cella provides. Used in frontend and backend.
- errors: error translations used in both frontend and backend
