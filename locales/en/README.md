# Locales

Here you can manage your locales. The basics are:

* About: for marketing page translations
* App: for app-specific translations. Also `organization`, `user` are duplicated here to make it easier to map all entity types using `app:[entity]`.
* Backend: backend-only translations
* Common: translations that are required for the basics that cella provides. Used in frontend and backend.
* Errors: error translations used in both frontend and backend
