# Deployment
> [!WARNING]
> Deployment is a work in progress. We are trying to build a deployment flow that consists out of 🇪🇺 European services. Apart from Github atm...😅 Want to help? Let's connect! ✉️ <info@cellajs.com>

Cella makes it easy to deploy on [Render](https://www.render.com) (backend, frontend). More options will become available over time.

## Deploy services to render.com

Go to [blueprints](https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=blueprint) and select the repo by clicking `Connect`.

Speed up the process by using the existing `render.yaml` file in the root.
