# Architecture
This document describes the high-level architecture of Cella.

 1. Only build what you are going to use yourself.
 2. Stay humble and remain a template, not a framework. So prevent abstraction layers.
 3. A single, opinionated stack: ie. Cella uses Drizzle ORM and will not make it replaceable with another ORM.
 4. Modularity. As CellaJS will grow, we need to make sure you can scaffold only the modules that you need.
 5. Open standards. Our long term vision is that each Cella - as in each cell - can speak fluently with other cells.

## Data modeling
Entities can be split in four types:
* All entities (`user`, `organization`, `attachments`)
* `PageEntity`: Entity that can be searched for (`user`, `organization`)
* `ContextEntity`: Has memberships (`organization`)
* `ProductEntity`: Content related entities without membership (`attachment`)

The default cella setup has one example product entity - `attachments` - and one context: `organizations`. 

## API Design
An OpenAPI is built with [zod-openapi](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/zod-openapi). Please read the readme in this middleware before you get started.

## Modularity
Both frontend and backend already have many modules in common, such as `authentication`, `users` and `organizations`. There are more frontend modules however, also for `home`, `marketing`, `navigation`. The benefit of modularity is twofold: better code (readability, portability etc) and to make receiving cella updates possible.

Zooming in on some of the frontend modules:
* `common`: a cella-predefined set of reusable react components and services 
* `ui`: Full with shadcn UI components. They have some small tweaks however and it is to be expected you will customize them yourself further.
* `attachments`: product entity module that has support for **offline, optimistic updates and realtime sync**.

A similar situation can be found in the `types` folders of both frontend and backend. you have app-specific types in `app.ts` and predefined cella types in `common.ts`.
