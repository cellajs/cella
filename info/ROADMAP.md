# Community involvement
Some things we would love to include in cella, but they are beyond the scope/resources we have ourselves. If you are interested in working on any of these, please let us know ([info@cellajs.com](mailto:info@cellajs.com)). We are open to funding it as an OS project üí∏, especially if you are based in Europe and will be using cella to build a new service.

Here are some examples - beyond our backlog - that that we could use help with:

* development over https with tunnel
* self-hosting using containerization
* Automated security audit / testing solution
* Perf testing with K6 / Grafana
* SSR Blog section using honox or tanstack start
* Embedded analytics service: embed dashboards for traffic and event analytics on multiple levels.
* Accessibility testing
