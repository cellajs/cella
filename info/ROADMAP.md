# Community involvement

Some things we would love to include in cella, but they are beyond the scope/resources we have ourselves. If you are interested in working on any of these, please let us know ([info@cellajs.com](mailto:info@cellajs.com)). We are open to funding it as an OS project, if you are based in Europe and will be using cella to build a new service.

Being able to embed dashboards for traffic and event analytics on multiple levels.

- app-wide
