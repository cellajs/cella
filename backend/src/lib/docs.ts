      (ATTENTION: PRERELEASE!) This API documentation is split in modules. Each module relates to a module in the backend codebase. Each module should be at least loosely-coupled, but ideally entirely decoupled. The documentation is based upon zod schemas that are converted to openapi specs using hono middleware: zod-openapi.

      API design differentiates between three types of resources: 

      1) page-related resources are called an 'entity' (ie ORGANIZATION or USER)
      2) a subclass are 'contextual entities' (ie ORGANIZATION, not USER)
      3) remaining data objects are simply content-related 'resources'.

      - Content-related resources - called simply 'resources' - dont have an API
        they run through the Electric SQL sync engine
      - SSE stream is not included in this API documentation
      - API design is flat, not nested
      - Production API is versioned
